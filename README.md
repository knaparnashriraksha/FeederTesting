The file index.html lists all the specifications

## Why this project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development (TDD)".
This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application.
All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## What did I learn?

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.
I also learned how to test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## How will this help my career?

- Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
- Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
